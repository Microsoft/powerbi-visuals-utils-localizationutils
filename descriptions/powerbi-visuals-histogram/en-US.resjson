    "long_description": "A Histogram shows history representation of the distribution of numerical data. It is an estimate of the probability distribution of a continuous variable (quantitative variable).\nThe data is grouped into bins, that is, divide the entire range of values into a series of intervalsâ€”and then count how many values fall into each interval.\nCustomize the number of bins, whether to use frequency or density, and the data colors.\nThis is an open source visual.
