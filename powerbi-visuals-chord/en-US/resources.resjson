This makes Chord Diagrams ideal for comparing the similarities within a dataset or between different groups of data.\nNodes are arranged around a circle, with the relationships between points connected to each other either through the use of arcs or BÃ©zier curves. Values are assigned to each connection, which is represented proportionally by the size of each arc.\nCustomize data colors, axis, labels and more.\nThis is an open source visual.
